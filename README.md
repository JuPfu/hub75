## Achievements of the Revised Driver

The modifications to the Pimoroni HUB75 driver result in the following improvements:

- **Offloading Work**: Moves processing from the CPU to DMA and PIO co-processors.
- **Performance Boost**: Implements self-paced, interlinked DMA and PIO processes.
- **Eliminates Synchronization Delays**: No need for `hub75_wait_tx_stall`, removing blocking synchronization.
- **Optimized Interrupt Handling**: Reduces code complexity in the interrupt handler.

These enhancements lead to significant performance improvements. In tests up to a **250 MHz system clock**, no ghost images were observed.

## Motivation

As part of a private project, I sought to gain deeper knowledge of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. I highly recommend **[Raspberry Pi Pico Lectures 2022 by Hunter Adams](https://www.youtube.com/c/HunterAdamsCornell/)**â€”they provide excellent insights! 

If you are specifically interested in **PIO (Programmable Input/Output)**, start with [Lecture 15: PIO Overview and Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kyd7mzxRsc).

Inspired by Adams' discussion on **[DMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGjUHChO1kM&list=PLDqMkB5cbBA5oDg8VXM110GKc-CmvUqEZ&index=7&t=1460s) and PIO co-processors**, I optimized the HUB75 driver as a self-assigned challenge.

## Evolution of Pico HUB75 Drivers

### Raspberry Pi Pico HUB75 Example

The **Pico HUB75 example** demonstrates connecting an **HUB75 LED matrix panel** using PIO. This educational example prioritizes clarity and ease of understanding.

- The color palette is generated by modulating the **Output Enable (OE)** signal.
- **Binary Coded Modulation (BCM)** is applied row-by-row, modulating all color bits before advancing to the next row.
- Synchronization depends on `hub75_wait_tx_stall`.
- **No DMA is used**, leading to lower performance.

### Pimoroni HUB75 Driver

The **Pimoroni HUB75 driver** improves performance by:
- Switching from **row-wise** to **plane-wise** modulation handling.
- Using **DMA** to transfer pixel data to the PIO state machine.
- Still relying on `hub75_wait_tx_stall` for synchronization.

## Eliminating `hub75_wait_tx_stall`

Both the **Raspberry Pi and Pimoroni** implementations use `hub75_wait_tx_stall`, which ensures:
- The state machine **stalls** on an empty TX FIFO.
- The system **waits** until the OEn pulse has finished.

However, this blocking method **prevents an efficient DMA-based approach**.

### Original `hub75_wait_tx_stall` Implementation
```c
static inline void hub75_wait_tx_stall(PIO pio, uint sm) {
    uint32_t txstall_mask = 1u << (PIO_FDEBUG_TXSTALL_LSB + sm);
    pio->fdebug = txstall_mask;
    while (!(pio->fdebug & txstall_mask)) {
        tight_loop_contents();
    }
}
```
### Alternative Approach
Instead of waiting for TX FIFO stalling, we can:
1. Modify the **PIO program** to emit a signal once the OEn pulse completes.
2. Set up a **DMA channel** to listen for this signal.
3. Establish an **interrupt handler** to trigger once the signal is received.

This approach allows fully **chained DMA execution** without CPU intervention.

## DMA Chains and PIO State Machines in the Revised HUB75 Driver

### Overview

The following diagram illustrates the interactions between **DMA channels** and **PIO state machines**:

```
[ Pixel Data DMA ] -> [ hub75_data_rgb888 PIO ]
       |
       |--> [ Dummy Pixel Data DMA ] -> [ hub75_data_rgb888 PIO ]
                  |
                  |--> [ OEn Data DMA ] -> [ hub75_row PIO ]
                           |
                           |--> [ OEn Finished DMA ] (Triggers interrupt)
```
### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Pixel Data Transfer**
   - Pixel data is streamed via **DMA** to the **hub75_rdata_gb888** PIO state machine.
   - This handles shifting pixel data into the LED matrix.

2. **Dummy Pixel Handling**
   - A secondary **dummy pixel DMA channel** adds additional pixel data.
   - This ensures correct clocking of the final piece of genuine data.

3. **OEn Pulse Generation**
   - The **OEn data DMA channel** sends 32-bit words - 5 bit address information (row select) and 27 bit puls width - to the **hub75_row** PIO state machine.
   - This output enable signal switches on those LEDs in the current row with bit set in the current bitplane for the specified number of cycles.

4. **Interrupt-Driven Synchronization**
   - A final **OEn finished DMA channel** listens for the end of the pulse.
   - An **interrupt handler** (`oen_finished_handler`) resets DMA for the next cycle.

### Refresh Rate Performance

With a **bit-depth of 10**, the HUB75 driver achieves the following refresh rates for a 64 x 64 matrix depending on the system clock:

| System Clock | Refresh Rate |
|--------------|---------------|
| 100 MHz      | 179 Hz        |
| 150 MHz      | 268 Hz        |
| 200 MHz      | 358 Hz        |
| 250 MHz      | 448 Hz        |

These results demonstrate stable operation and high-performance display rendering across a wide range of system clocks.

### Key Benefits of this Approach
âœ… Fully **automated** data transfer using **chained DMA channels**.

âœ… Eliminates **CPU-intensive** busy-waiting (`hub75_wait_tx_stall`).

âœ… Ensures **precise timing** without unnecessary stalling.

## Conclusion

By offloading tasks to **DMA and PIO**, the revised HUB75 driver achieves **higher performance**, **simpler interrupt handling**, and **better synchronization**. This approach significantly reduces CPU overhead while eliminating artifacts like **ghosting** at high clock speeds.

If you're interested in optimizing **RGB matrix panel drivers**, this implementation serves as a valuable reference for efficient DMA-based rendering.
